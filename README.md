# smallcheck - an exhaustive checker

smallcheck is an exhaustive checker.

In the vein of [quickcheck](https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck)
`smallcheck` is a testing tool which asks that you specify properites of the
system under test and automatically generates inputs for testing. Where
`quickcheck` uses random sampling over the domain of inputs `smallcheck`
exhausts the domain, to some 'depth', going from smallest to largest values.

This implementation is based on:

I listened to so much Brian Eno when writing this library. So. Much.
